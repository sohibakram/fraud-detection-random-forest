# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Random Forest

## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning application for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.  
A Random Forest classifier is used to identify fraud patterns in highly imbalanced data, and the model is deployed using a Streamlit web application for interactive predictions.

## Problem Statement
Credit card fraud detection is a challenging classification problem due to extreme class imbalance. Fraudulent transactions represent a very small percentage of total transactions, making it essential to build a model that can accurately detect fraud while minimizing false positives.

## Solution Approach
- Used Random Forest Classifier for robust and reliable performance
- Addressed imbalanced dataset challenges
- Trained and serialized the model for reuse
- Developed a Streamlit-based web interface for real-time predictions
